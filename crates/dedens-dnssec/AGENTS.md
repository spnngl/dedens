# dedens-dnssec

DNSSEC validation, sans-IO (D69): signatures, denial of existence and the chain of trust over records its
caller fetched. The caller owns the clock, the questions and the sockets. Crypto is `ring` (D71), nothing
else. One module per concern; tests of RFC behaviour in `tests/rfcNNNN.rs`.
